title: Apache Flink Training
layout: page

[Apache Flink](http://flink.apache.org)<sup>&reg;</sup> is an open source platform for scalable batch and stream data processing. It offers expressive APIs to define batch and streaming data flow programs and a robust and scalable engine to execute these jobs. 


### Goals and scope of this training

This training teaches how to implement scalable data analysis programs using Apache Flink. For now, the training focuses on Flink's DataSet API for batch processing. The training will be extended to cover a broader range of use cases in the future.

Specifically, this training teaches:

- How to setup an environment to develop Flink programs
  - Setup all required software and tools and configure an IDE
  - Create a Maven project for Flink programs and import it into an IDE
  - Execute and debug a Flink program locally in an IDE

- How to implement Flink programs using
	- Exercises for Flink batch programs using the DataSet API
	- Exercises for Flink batch programs using the Table API
  
- How to package, execute, and monitor Flink programs on running Flink systems


## TODO

- Add a POJO somewhere
