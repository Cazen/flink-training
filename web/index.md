[Apache Flink](http://flink.apache.org)<sup>&reg;</sup> is an open source platform for scalable batch and stream data processing. It offers expressive APIs to define batch and streaming data flow programs and a robust and scalable engine to execute these jobs. 


### Goals and scope of this training

This training teaches how to implement scalable data analysis programs using Apache Flink. 

Specifically, this training teaches:

- How to setup an environment to develop Flink programs
  - Setup all required software and tools and configure an IDE
  - Create a Maven project for Flink programs and import it into an IDE
  - Execute and debug a Flink program locally in an IDE

- How to implement Flink programs using
	- Exercises for Flink batch programs using the DataSet API
	- Exercises for Flink stream programs using the DataStream API
	- Exercises for Flink batch programs using the Table API
  
- How to package, execute, and monitor Flink programs on running Flink systems
