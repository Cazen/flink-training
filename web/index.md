Flink offers expressive APIs to define batch and streaming data flow programs and a robust and scalable engine to execute these jobs.

### Goals & Scope of the Training

This training is intended for people who want to learn to analyze data with Apache Flink. For now, the training focuses on Flink's DataSet API for batch processing. The training will be extended to cover a broader range of use cases.
