### Instructions to publish the webpage

- Build the page for publication to `gh-pages` branch with `build.sh` script. This updates the `gh-pages` branch, which then can previewed at: http://dataartisans.github.io/flink-training
- Preview on `localhost:4000` with `preview.sh` script. The result in `_site` cannot be put to the `gh-pages` branch, because the baseurl is not set correctly.
