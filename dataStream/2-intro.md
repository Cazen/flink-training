Time is an important aspect of stream processing, for instance it is usually required for windows that enable aggregations over infinite streams. Flink supports different ways to interpret time and a features very expressive window semantics.

In this lesson you will learn

* why time is important in stream processing,
* what processing-time, event-time, and watermarks are,
* how windows are used to compute aggregates on infinite streams, 
* which types of windows Flink supports, and
* how to implement a DataStream program with a window aggregation.
